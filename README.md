# 👋 Hi, I'm Shashwat Mishra

I'm a systems engineer and technical leader with a decade-long track record of building high-performance, low-latency systems across fintech, edtech, and embedded domains.

Most of my work lives behind closed doors — production code powering trading engines, real-time analytics pipelines, distributed services, and infrastructure for fast-moving teams. I'm not just a builder; I'm a system thinker, obsessed with edge-case correctness, creative expressiveness in code, and architecture that bends without breaking.

## ⚙️ What I Do

- 🛠 **Built** [Raito](https://github.com/shashwatmi/raito), a Rust-based trading engine with live scripting and backtesting via a custom DSL.
- 🧪 **Designed** a domain-specific scripting language on top of Rhai, complete with custom syntax parsing, metadata annotations, and documentation pipelines.
- 🛰 **Engineered** real-time systems from the ground up — with in-memory data stores, predictable latencies, and careful dataflow design.
- 🔧 **Delivered** internal tools and feedback loops that made engineering teams faster, safer, and more confident in production.

## 🧠 Tech Stack & Tools

**Languages:** Rust, Go, Python, C++, PHP, C#, Assembly, Haskell  
**Systems:** Postgres, Redis, NATS, WebAssembly (WASM)  
**Infra:** Docker, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana  
**Patterns:** Distributed Systems, Event-Driven Design, Real-Time Dataflows

## 🧩 What I'm Really Good At

My specialty isn’t a language or framework — it’s **solving hard technical problems where no playbook exists**.

Whether it’s designing a new DSL, shaving microseconds off critical paths, or building infrastructure that scales under pressure — I bring calm, clarity, and deep systems thinking to ambiguous challenges.

## 📊 Highlights

- ⚡ Reduced trading latency by **70%+**, handling **100K+ trades/sec** under synthetic load.
- 🧠 Built a live backtesting system that enables real-time iteration on trading strategies.
- 🧭 Led and mentored cross-functional teams (3–6 engineers), collaborating tightly with product, infra, and quant teams.
- 🚧 Shipped foundational infrastructure that unlocked entire product lines and enabled faster experimentation.

## 🚀 Notable Projects

- **Raito** – Low-latency trading engine with live strategy scripting
- **Simulo** – Simulation toolkit for rapid backtests and stress tests ([repo](https://github.com/shashwatmi/simulo))

## 🌍 Community & Engineering Culture

- 🛠 Advocate for clean APIs, expressive tooling, and developer experience.
- 📚 Contributor to internal systems design documentation and language tooling.
- 🧠 Passionate about building tools that empower other builders.

## 🧭 Core Engineering Principles

- **First principles > frameworks**  
- **Clarity over cleverness**  
- **Build for change, not just for now**  
- **Code should teach its reader**

## 🤔 Why My GitHub Looks Quiet

Most of my work exists behind firewalls — production systems for companies, not public repos.  
But when I do open-source something, I care deeply about polish, docs, and design.

Curious about my work? I’m happy to discuss private projects or swap engineering stories.
