# 👋 Hi, I'm Shashwat Mishra

I'm a **systems engineer** and **technical leader** with over **seven years of experience** building high-performance, **low-latency systems** across **fintech, edtech, and embedded domains**. My work powers production trading engines, real-time analytics, distributed platforms, and embedded solutions—often behind firewalls.

I excel at **system design**, **creative problem-solving**, and crafting architecture that is **resilient, scalable, and easy to evolve**. I thrive in **async-first teams**, known for combining rapid prototyping with a deep focus on **developer experience** and **business impact**.

## ⚙️ What I Do

- 🛠 **Built _Raito_**, a Rust-based, production-grade trading engine with live scripting and backtesting via a custom DSL  
- 🧪 **Designed a strategy DSL**, enabling composable analytics and real-time iteration in live and simulated markets  
- 🛰 **Engineered real-time, event-driven systems** with in-memory data stores and predictable, sub-millisecond latency  
- 🔧 **Delivered foundational infrastructure**, developer tools, and live data pipelines used in national-scale events and high-concurrency systems  
- 🤝 **Led and mentored cross-functional teams**, working closely with product, infra, and quantitative stakeholders

## 🤔 Why My GitHub Looks Quiet

Most of my work lives behind company firewalls — powering production systems, not public repos.  
Curious about what I’ve built? I’m happy to discuss private projects or swap engineering stories.
